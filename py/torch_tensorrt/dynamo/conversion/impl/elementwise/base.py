    """
    This function adds a TensorRT elementwise layer. We allow both operands to be
    constant (not a trt tensor) because in implicit batch dimension mode, we could
    introduce constant via .size() op. Other scenario should be const folded first.
    If any operand is not a trt tensor, we make it a trt constant layer while preserve
    its dtype. Then we broadcast these two inputs to have the same number of dimensions.
    We also promote the types of the two tensors to avoid dtype errors in TRT.

    Limitation:
        If we are using implicit batch dim mode, the operand that is not a trt
    tensor are not allowed to have larger ranks than the trt tensor operand.

    Args:
        network (TRTNetwork): TensorRT network object.
        target (Target): Target of fx node.
        source_ir (SourceIR): The IR that is calling the function.
        name (str): The name we want to assign to the created TensorRT layer.
        lhs_val (TRTTensor): Left operand of the binary operation. Could
            be a TensorRT tensor, a PyTorch tensor or a simple value.
        rhs_val (TRTTensor): Right operand of the binary operation. Similar
            to lhs_val.
        op_type (trt.ElementWiseOperation): Type of the TensorRT elementwise binary operation.

    Returns:
        The output of TensorRT Elementwise layer.
